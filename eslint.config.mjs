  // The end-to-end harness is two programs in one directory, and they do not share an
  // environment:
  //
  //  - the driver (`run.mjs`, `lib/`, `provision.mjs`, …) is Node — it spawns Foundry and
  //    steers Playwright;
  //  - `in-world/` is served over HTTP into Foundry's own page and runs in the *browser*, with
  //    every Foundry global in scope, importing the module under test directly.
  //
  // The driver gets the browser and Foundry globals as well, and that is not laziness. It hands
  // closures to Playwright — `session.eval(() => game.world.id)`, `page.addInitScript(...)` —
  // whose bodies are serialised and executed *in the page*. ESLint sees an ordinary arrow
  // function in a Node file and cannot know it will be evaluated somewhere else entirely, so
  // those globals have to be declared for the file that carries them. The cost is that a
  // genuine typo in Node-side code could name a Foundry global and go unflagged; the
  // alternative was a couple of dozen inline disables.
