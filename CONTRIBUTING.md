# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. This is a Foundry VTT module for the D&D 5e
system, and it moves things of value between actors, so most changes need checking in a real
world as well as in the test suite.

## Getting set up

```sh
npm install        # dev tooling only — nothing here ships in the module archive
npm run check      # syntax, JSON, localisation, packaging, lint, unit tests (what CI runs)
npm run package    # build dist/module.zip exactly as a release would
```

To try the module in Foundry, symlink or copy the repository into your
`Data/modules/` directory as `sogrom-simple-dnd5e-magic-shop`.

### The end-to-end harness

`test-e2e/` drives a real Foundry install with a GM and two player clients joined at once. It is
where the GM-authoritative trade path is actually proved — prices re-derived on the GM, forged
requests refused, two players racing for the last item — and CI cannot run it, because a hosted
runner has no Foundry licence and no content packs.

```sh
cd test-e2e
npm install
cp config.example.mjs config.mjs    # then point it at your Foundry install and data folder
node provision.mjs                  # once: creates the test world, users and characters
npm test
```

Foundry must be closed while it runs; it starts its own server against your data folder.

## Before opening a pull request

- `npm run check` passes locally.
- If the change touches trading, pricing, stock or attitude, the end-to-end harness passes too.
- User-facing strings go through `lang/en.json` rather than being hard-coded.
- The public API and hook surface does not change by accident. Hook names live in `HOOKS` in
  `scripts/config.mjs` and are asserted by name in `test-e2e/in-world/api.mjs` — if that suite
  fails because you renamed one, the suite is right and the rename is a breaking change for every
  module listening to it. Adding a hook means adding it to `HOOKS`, firing it through `fireHook()`
  or `fireCancellableHook()`, and extending that suite.
- Anything that writes to documents during a trade goes through the settlement queue in
  `scripts/data/serial.mjs`. Foundry has no transactions; the queue is what stops two
  purchases of the last item from both succeeding.
- Unit tests cover the changed behaviour where the behaviour is testable outside Foundry.
- The change has been clicked through in a real world — unit tests don't cover the UI.
  Say which Foundry version, D&D 5e system version, and content modules you tested against.

Keep pull requests small and focused; unrelated changes bundled together are much slower
to review. The pull request template asks for the same details, so filling it in is enough.

## Commit messages

Write a short imperative subject line describing the change, and use the body for the
reasoning if it isn't obvious from the diff. See also the two sections below: every commit
needs a sign-off, and no commit should carry AI tool attribution.

### Sign your work — the Developer Certificate of Origin

Every commit must be signed off. Sign-off is a single trailer at the end of the commit
message:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

`git commit -s` adds it for you, using your configured `user.name` and `user.email`, so
set those once and forget about it:

```sh
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Adding that line certifies that you wrote the change, or otherwise have the right to
submit it under this project's licence. The full text of what you are certifying is the
Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1, reproduced verbatim in [DCO](DCO) at the root of this
repository — it is worth reading once.

This is **not** a contributor licence agreement. There is no paperwork to sign and no
rights are assigned to anyone; you are simply asserting, per commit, that the code was
yours to give. It matters particularly for AI-assisted changes: whichever tool you used,
the sign-off is you taking responsibility for the licensing of what you submitted.

If you would rather not remember the `-s` flag on every commit, this repository ships a
hook that adds the trailer for you — including on commits made from an editor's
source-control panel, which never pass `-s`:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Note that `git config format.signOff true` does **not** do this, despite how it reads:
that setting is honoured only by `git format-patch` and `git send-email`, and git has no
`commit.signOff` equivalent. Setting it and expecting signed-off commits is the usual way
to arrive at a red DCO check.

If you forget, CI will tell you. To fix it:

```sh
git commit --amend -s --no-edit       # the most recent commit
git rebase --signoff origin/main      # every commit on your branch
```

Then force-push the branch.

### AI-assisted contributions

AI coding assistants are permitted. You remain fully responsible for the correctness,
licensing, and style compliance of anything you submit, and you must be able to explain
your change on request.

Please do **not** include AI tool attribution in commit messages. Remove trailers such as
`Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`, `Co-authored-by: Copilot ...`, "Generated with ..." footers,
and similar tool sign-offs before opening a pull request. Co-author trailers are reserved
for human contributors.

A local hook catches this before you commit — the same `core.hooksPath` setting as the
sign-off hook above turns both on, so you only need it once:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The same check runs in CI on every pull request
(`.github/workflows/no-ai-attribution.yml`), so a stray trailer will fail the build.

## Releases

Releases are built by `.github/workflows/main.yml` when a GitHub release is published with a
version tag (`v1.2.3` or `1.2.3`). It runs the whole of CI against the tagged commit first, then
builds the archive with `tools/build-release.mjs`, verifies the unpacked archive, and attaches
`module.json` and `module.zip` to the release. Run the end-to-end harness before tagging.

What goes into the archive is listed once, in `tools/release-files.mjs`. A new top-level folder
the module loads from has to be added there, and `npm run validate:package` fails until it is.

## Translations

Translations are wanted. The module is fully keyed — every player-facing string already lives in
`lang/en.json` — so a new language is a translation job rather than a code change, and it is the
single most useful contribution someone who doesn't write JavaScript can make.

**Translations must be written by a human.** This is the one place where the allowance above does
not apply: machine-translated or AI-generated language files are not accepted, in line with
Foundry's package policy on AI-generated content. Run a draft through a tool to help yourself if you
like, but what you submit has to be your own work, checked by someone who actually speaks the
language, and your sign-off says exactly that.

To add one:

1. Copy `lang/en.json` to `lang/<code>.json`, using the same language code Foundry uses (`de`,
   `fr`, `pt-BR`, and so on).
2. Translate the values. Leave the keys alone, and keep every `{placeholder}` intact and spelled
   the same — they are filled in at runtime, and a renamed one renders as literal text.
3. Add the file to the `languages` array in `module.json`.
4. Run `npm run check`; `validate:json` will catch a malformed file and `validate:package` a
   language path that does not exist.
5. Load a world in your language and open the Trader Manager and a shop in both trade and barter
   modes. Long translations are the usual source of layout problems, and only looking will find
   them.

Partial translations are fine — Foundry falls back to English for any key you leave out — so a
first pass covering the shop window players see most is a welcome pull request on its own. If you
are picking up a language someone else started, say so in the pull request so the work isn't
duplicated.
